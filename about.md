# About us

Welcome to the **Computer Science Society**, or CSS for short. We are the departmental society at the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham. 

We are one of the over 300 Guild of Students societies and one of the 35+ EPS College societies. Being a student is not just about working hard, you have to enjoy it too! That is why CSS is working making sure to create events and provide a medium through which computer scientists can meet, make friends, and partake in a whole lot of exciting activities.

## What do we do

We run a variety of events around the year, such as:
* Parties and Food Nights
* Quiz Nights
* Games Nights and LAN Parties
* Hackathons
* Careers and Tech Talks
* Workshops
* and much more!

We also organise special events, such as trips, Christmas meals, annual CSS Ball and others! We are always completely open to suggestions too, so if there's an event you would like to see, get in contact with us.

Most importantly, we also proivde lots of **free pizza** at many of our events. Last year we provided almost 500kg of pizza to our members. 

## How do I get involved

Membership through the Guild costs only Â£5 for a year. Follow the links below to the Guild of Students website to purchase your membership. Membership gives you access to all of our events and you also get a free CSS T-shirt!

Each year we hold an AGM (Annual General Meeting) in March to elect our committee for the year. We have a variety of different roles, which you can check out on our Committee page. We also hold another election at the start of the academic year to elect a new First Year Rep and PGT Rep.

Every event we run will be advertised on our Facebook Group, Twitter and Instagram, as well as via. the Calendar page on our website. So stay tuned for all of the latest updates.

## Hackathons

A hackathonis a (usually 24 hours) event in which teams work together to create a piece of software for certain challenges, which may with the team some awesome prizes. They are a great way to meet new people, talk with different companies and learn new things. Each year we encourage members to get involved with hackathons since it's a great way to learn, build and share. 

One of the groups we work closesly with is HackTheMidlands. They run a large hackathon inclusive for all age 14+ whether they are a complete beginner or an industry professional. This year it is being held in Millennium Point over the 26th and 27th of October. Visit [hackthemidlands.com](https://hackthemidlands.com) to find out more and get your tickets.
