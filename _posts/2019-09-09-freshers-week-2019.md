**Welcome to all of the new members and returning members**

It's September and the new adacemic year is about to start. That means only one thing: Freshers' Week!

We've got lots of fun things planned for everyone who is coming to the uni for the first time, and also everyone who is returning too.

## Freshers' Week Events

We encourage everyone to come to as many events as you can: it's a great way to meet your fellow course-mates and make some new friends. All of our events are inclusive and open to absolutely everyone no matter who you are! Below is a list of all of the events we have planned for you in the first few weeks of the semester. Also, incase you haven't seen it yet, we've updated our website (see below) and you can find the new [calendar page](https://cssbham.com/calendar) where you can see all of the events at any time.
