**We've given our website a new look!**

Over the last few months we've been working hard to update the look of our website. Previosuly, the website only consisted of a one page with the links that is now the [home page](http://cssbham.com/). We have now added more features to the website:
* **[/newsletter](http://cssbham.com/newsletter)** - This is our new blog post area. Here we will post updates, such at this one you're reading now. You wull be able to read what we've been getting up to as a society, as being able to find out more information about our events. 
* **[/committee](http://cssbham.com/committee)** - That's us! Here you can find more about us - the team that is running your society and its events. Feel free to contact us if yo want to find out more about how we run the society.
* **[/calendar](http://cssbham.com/calendar)** - We now have a calendar page that you can find a list of all the events which we have coming up. You can switch between a list and calendar view, or even add the calendar to your own one.
* **[/about](http://cssbham.com/about)** - This page is for some more information about the society. Find out more about what we do in general and you can follow us on social media too. 

**Our tech stack:**
