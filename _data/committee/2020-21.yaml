      I'm Jacqui, the president of CSS! My role is to manage the society and
      committee, as well as represent CSS at the guild. When I'm not stressing
      out over responsibilities and deadlines, I spend a lot of my time playing
      RPGs and drinking iced lemon tea.

      As Socials Rep it’s my job to make sure you have as much fun and feel as
      included as possible by running plenty of social events and meetups! In
      the unlikely event you can’t find me in Sloman or the labs, I’m probably
      either playing guitar or running along the canals.

    role: Sports Rep
    bio: >
      Hi everyone, my name is Daniel Stoica and I will be your Sprorts Rep for
      the next year. I am very excited to share my passion for both sport and
      E-sports with all of you.
      As I previously mentioned I am gonna focus on motivating everyone to take
      part in any sport regarding their experience; as long as it's something
      you enjoy, feel free to come and even be part of an amazing team.
      I will organise meetings where everyone can share their thoughts on the
      current sports teams, as well as on the newer ones that are yet to come.
      Also, I will be focusing on the E-sports, where I would like to expand
      the variety of video games in which our society is represented.

      I’m responsible for showing off CSS to the rest of the world! To do that,
      I photograph our events, promote them on social media and update this
      website regularly. In my spare time, I listen to music, watch films and
      work on my own projects.

    role: Post-Graduate (Research) Rep
    bio: >
      Hey, I'm Dan, I'm a 1st year PhD student and I'm the new Postgrad rep for
      research students. I was the CSS PGT rep during my MSc back in 2016/17,
      then I went to work for a few years and now I'm back. My job this year
      will be to get more PhD and MRes students involved in CSS events.
      My research is in Cyber Security, focusing on the (in)security of
      Bluetooth, and outside of that I enjoy competing in CTF competitions and
      Rock Climbing.
