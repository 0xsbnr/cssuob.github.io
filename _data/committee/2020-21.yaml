      I'm Jacqui, the president of CSS! My role is to manage the society and
      committee, as well as represent CSS at the guild. When I'm not stressing
      out over responsibilities and deadlines, I spend a lot of my time playing
      RPGs and drinking iced lemon tea.

      Hi I’m Jake and this academic year I will be managing the societies finances.
      I am going into my 4th year and plan to spend it playing DnD, drinking, and completing the occasional assignment.
      I look forward to a year full of interesting events hosted by this society.

      Hi everyone! My role this year is to make sure that all events run smoothly and that everyone feels included
      in our computer science community.
      I love organising events and networking. I am always looking for
      personal development and career opportunities, so if you are keen on talking about internships, CVs or interview
      prepping, I would love to help you!

      Hi, I'm Rob. It’s my job to make sure you have as much fun as possible
      by running social events and meetups! This year, I want more people coming to these. In
      the unlikely event you that can’t find me in the Sloman lounge or in the labs, I’m probably
      either playing guitar or running along the canals.

  - name: Adrian David
    role: International Student Rep
    bio: >
      My goal is to promote the society and its events to students who aren't from the UK.
      This year, I want to help everyone feel welcome and at home.
      In my free time I like working out and binge-watching TV shows.

  - name: Jacob Wilson
    role: Special Events Rep
    bio: >
      I ensure that all of our big social events (like the CSS Ball and the Christmas meal) run
      smoothly and that everyone has a good time. I hope to make all of our events special throughout the
      year! In my spare time, I drink wine and fence as part of the University's fencing team
      (sometimes concurrently).

    role: Diversity, Equality and Inclusivity Rep
    bio: >
      My role is to make everyone feel included and represented at all our events,
      no matter their background. I also help arrange our international events,
      making sure we offer a diverse set of activities for our whole community.
      Aside from this, I mostly waste time by watching
      horror movies and reading murder mysteries. Feel free to contact me with any suggestions or concerns!

  - name: Daniel Stoica
    role: Sports Rep
    bio: >
      I encourage everyone (regardless of your level or experience) to take
      part in our sports and e-sports events! One of my goals this year is to increase the amount of people
      involved in e-sports. When time allows, I love to go to the gym, read books and play video games.

  - name: George Baker
    role: Publicity Rep
    bio: >
      I’m responsible for showing off CSS to the rest of the world! To do that,
      I photograph our events, promote them on social media and update this
      website regularly. In my spare time, I listen to music, watch films and
      work on my own projects.

  - name: Likkan Chung
    role: Industrial Rep
    bio: >
      I'm a fourth year undergrade on my Year in Industry at Kainos.
      As our Industrial Liaison, I bring industry and careers events to the society.
      Outside of CSS, I help organise events like HackTheMidlands and
      I'm also a student ambassador for the department.

  - name: Ammaar Sultan
    role: Interim First Year Rep
    bio: >
      I want to make sure that the new first years feel
      welcome during their initial few weeks at Birmingham. I will encourage them to join
      CSS and make it as homely as possible for them. The key to this: icebreaker
      events! If you ever feel lost or just want to chat, feel free to send me a message.
      Outside of CSS, I like gaming, cooking
      and seeing deadlines tick away (while procrastinating).

  - name: Dan Clark
    role: Post-Graduate (Research) Rep
    bio: >
      My job this year is to get more PhD and MRes students involved in CSS events.
      My research is in Cyber Security, focusing on the (in)security of
      Bluetooth. Outside of that, I enjoy competing in CTF competitions and
      Rock Climbing. I was the CSS PGT rep during my MSc back in 2016/17,
      then I went to work for a few years (and now I'm back)!
