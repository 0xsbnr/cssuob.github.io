    paragraph: "We weren't going to let Covid get in the way of our annual ball, so we decided to host our
    first ever online CSS Ball. Gather.Town was our venue of choice, where we created a virtual palace complete
    with dining hall, dance floor and hidden treasure. Proximity voice and video chat was also enabled, so
    guests could walk around, chat and show off their outfits!"

  - title: "But what about food?"
    paragraph: "Don't worry, we had that covered! Each guest received an Uber Eats voucher (worth more than the 
    ticket cost!) which they used to get their favourite dish delivered straight to their door. And just like   
    at any other ball, we sat together at (virtual) tables!"

  - title: "...and drink?"
    paragraph: "The great thing about this year was that we could bring any drink we wanted. We even created    
    our own cocktail just for the event!"

    paragraph: "After we'd eaten, we enjoyed the custom-built maze and a treasure hunt around the map we had    
    created. We had a group photo competition, and got up to some famous CSS shenanigans. Everyone had an 
    absolute blast, and for many of us it was the highlight of the year!"
