The Covid-19 pandemic has caused a lot of disruption worldwide to everybody, CSS included. Usually we would hold our Committee Elections in March as part of our Annual General Meeting. The AGM was planned to take place on Tuesday 17th March 2020. We were aware that due to the impending restrictions which would come, many society members may have already travelled home or would not want to meet at an event. Therefore, we decided to postpone the meeting until such a time we could hold a meeting and election in such a way that it would be fair and inclusive.

In the regular AGM, we would give a report of the year from the President and Treasurer as outlined in our [Constitution](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J3_EWs3dd2gq5T_xYylcP5pDzm0HHAYCTgiqKUYwkls/edit). As we are now holding our Elections online, we are also publishing these reports online. The Reports below outline what CSS has done since the current committee were elected in Spring 2019 and a summary of our financial position.

## The Reports

"This year for CSS was a record breaking one. We have over 280 members, the biggest number we have ever had. We ran over 60 events, from workshops to socials to talks to sports, and if the circumstances were different, even more events would have been held.
<br><br>
Some of the most notable events were the yearly events: the Ming Moon trip, the Halloween Pub Quiz and the Christmas Meal, which brought in a lot of people together; and the events run with sponsors and donors, such as the Kainos Office Trip and the Qiskit Workshops and Hackathon. CSS attended HackTheMidlands again this year, where many great projects have been conceived by our members, and we hope that the tradition will continue. The CSS Ball was the largest one yet, which had 130 attendees and tons of fun. We have also run the Developer Student Club during the year, which helped our members pick up many useful skills along the year.We have also run joint events with other societies, such as AFNOM, oSTEM, GDS and Calligraphy Society.
<br><br>
In conclusion, this year was record breaking (like most of the past years), and we are proud of keeping the tradition of pushing ourselves to new heights each year.

"Overall, 2019/20 was a fruitful year during which our resources enabled us to organise no fewer than 60 events, to provide refreshments and snacks when needed and to keep offering free T-shirts for members. We would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to our sponsors, Argos, IBM and Kainos, as well as to our members, whose contributions were indispensable for our activity. We would also like to thank the School of Computer Science for covering some of our expenses and the Guild of Students for the financial support they provided.

CSS in Numbers

Unfortunately, due to the unprecedented situation we find ourselves in, several transactions still need to be processed. However, those accounted for, we are proudly announcing the CSS will finish the academic year with a positive net balance." %}

## The Committee Elections
Ballots are now open for the Committee Elections 2020. You can view the list of candidates for each position and vote on the [Guild website](https://guildofstudent.com/vote/). Remember that in order to be able to vote, you must be a full member of CSS (i.e. you have purchased membership via. the Guild Website). Voting will continue until this Wednesday 29th April, when they close at 16:00 BST, so make sure you get your vote in!

For each position there may be multiple candidates, and you can also vote for RON (Re-open nominations) if you feel no candidates are suitable. Voting is a single transferable vote (the same as the Guild Elections), where votes are redistributed until one candidate reaches the required number of votes. Once the voting closes, CSS will be given the results in the following week and we will aim to announce these as soon as possible.

If you have any questions or complaints about the elections please contact the current Committee, or you can email the Guild directly at elections@guild.bham.ac.uk or call 0121 251 2428.

Good luck to all of the candidates!
