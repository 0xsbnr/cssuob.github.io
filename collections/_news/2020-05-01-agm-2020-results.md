**Congratulations to all of those who have been elected!** The current committee will be in touch with that next steps regarding training and handover. We would also like to wish a well done to all the other candidates who have not been successful. Your campaigns were excellently fought and it's clear how much effort you have put into them. Although you may not be on committee, that doesn't mean you can't help us to put on excellent events throughout next year, and you can always run again next year.
