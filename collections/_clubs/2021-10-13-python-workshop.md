After an 18-month gap of not being able to hold in person events, we were eager to get back into things with more workshops.

We kicked off with a Python Workshop early in 2021, specifically aimed at students who hadn't used Python before.

The workshop covered everything from the basics of how python works, inputs, data structures, and of course the traditional "Hello World!"
