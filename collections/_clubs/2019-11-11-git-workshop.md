[Justin](https://twitter.com/jedevc) and
[Will](https://twitter.com/wrussell1999) hosted the "Git Bit", an
introduction to the best VCS out there ðŸ¥°

In the workshop, we covered everything from making a first commit, all the
way to resolving some merge conflicts ðŸŽ‰ At the end, everyone signed the
[guestbook](https://wrussell1999.github.io/dsc-guestbook/) by forking the
repo and making a Pull Request!
