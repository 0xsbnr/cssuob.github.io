<h1>Committee</h1>

<p><b>Following the Results of the Committee Elections, this page will be updated shortly.</b></p>

<p>
  The CSS committee represents all of our members and takes
  responsibility for planning and organizing the society as well as
  running events throughout the year.
</p>
<p>
  For previous years see <a href="/committee-archive.html">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Currently, for the academic year {{ site.data.committee[0].academic_year }}
  we have {{ site.data.committee[0].people.size }} committee members:
</p>

<div class="person-container fadein-container">
  {% for person in site.data.committee[0].people %}
  <div class="person fadein hidden">
    <img class="picture" src="{{ person.picture | relative_url }}" alt="picture of {{ person.name }}">
    <div class="details">
      <span class="name">{{ person.name }}</span>
      <span class="role">{{ person.role }}</span>
      <p class="bio">
        {{ person.bio }}
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  {% endfor %}
